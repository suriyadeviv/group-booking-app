# Group Booking Request Form

A reimplementation of Premier‚ÄØInn‚Äôs Group Booking Enquiry Form for both UK and German markets, built using **Next.js 15 (App Router)** and **Tailwind CSS**.

---

## üåç Overview

This multi-step form allows users to submit group booking enquiries. It supports internationalization, dark/light themes, client/server validation, and accessible, responsive design.

### üßæ Form Sections

The form has three accordion-based sections:
1. **Contact Details**
2. **Booking Preferences**
3. **Room Requirements**

- All required fields are marked with `*`.
- Validation is triggered when continuing to the next section.
- On successful submission, the form is saved locally.

---

## üåê Internationalization

- A locale switcher is available in the header.
- Currently supports **English (UK)** and **German**, and is easily extendable to more languages using `next-intl`.
- Localized routes like:
    - /en-GB/booking
    - /de-DE/booking

---

## üé® Theme Toggle

- Users can toggle between **light** and **dark** themes via the header.
- Theme preference is stored and persisted.

---

## ‚úÖ Form Validation

- The form uses React Hook Form and Zod libraries to check your input step-by-step.
- If you miss a required field or enter something incorrectly, a clear message will show up just below the field.
- You can only move to the next section once all required fields are filled in correctly.

---

## üì• Form Submission

- Each section is wrapped in an **accordion UI**, advancing only after validation.
- Final form submission saves data to `/mock-data/submissions.json`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: In local dev this works fine, but on **Vercel**, file system writes will not persist. Consider integrating a backend (e.g. Supabase/Firebase) for production deployments.

---

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- **Integrate analytics hooks** (e.g., Google Analytics, Plausible) to track user interactions and drop-off points in the booking flow.
- **Real-time form progress indicator** to visually show users how far they've progressed in the multi-step form.
- **Enable backend integration** to persist form submissions (e.g., Supabase, Firebase).
- **Introduce reCAPTCHA** or hCaptcha to prevent spam submissions.
- **Enhance mobile UX** by optimizing field arrangement and touch interactions.
- **Support additional locales** dynamically through external CMS or translation services.
- **Implement rate limiting** or throttling on the mock API layer for realism and performance simulation.
